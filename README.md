#### Credit:
These are some topics of OpenCV that I learn from a publicly available [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o). The code files has been created by me when I was practicing the tutorial.

#### My Contributions:
I tried to add comments to the terms and lines of codes that I thought would be helpful for me in future. I also tried to add some extra lines of codes to the tutorial codes to make it more understandable. I also added some extra codes that I thought would be helpful for me in future.

Thank you for visiting my repository.
